review/text: The people who have reviewed this DVD before me have said it all! It is just great! Came across the concert on PBS one night and decided to buy it then and there. After viewing it once I also bought DOO WOP 50 and DOO WOP 51. What a wonderful nostalgic trip to the past! You will never regret buying this DVD.

review/text: I have all of the doo wop DVD's and this one is as good or better than the 1st ones. Remember once these performers are gone, we'll never get to see them again. Rhino did an excellent job and if you like or love doo wop and Rock n Roll you'll LOVE this DVD !!

review/text: The performance of Little Anthony and the Imperials singing &quot;Two Kinds of People&quot; acappella is worth the price of admission; they haven't lost a step!  The rest is simply gravy.

review/text: Get it, also get Dop Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51. Each performances is like the original 45's, except with modern, nice ,crisp sound like today's cds.
